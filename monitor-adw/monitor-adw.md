## Task 1: Monitoring ADW activity generated by OAC
The **ADW Service Console** provides dashboards to monitor the real-time and historical CPU and storage utilization, as well as database activity, like the number of running or queued statements.

1.  Launch **Database Service Console**.  
Log in to **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console**, select **Autonomous Data Warehouse** from the Hamburger Menu and navigate to your ADW instance.  

    Enter your **User Name**, **Password** and Click **Sign In.**

2.  Click on the hamburger **MENU** link at the upper left corner of the page.  
This will produce a drop-down menu, where you select **Autonomous Data Warehouse.** 

    ![Autonomous Data Warehouse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-adw.png)

3.  Select your Compartment and Click on your ADW instance

    ![Select ADW](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwhselect.png)

4.  In your ADW **Database Details** page, click the **Service Console** button.

    ![Service Console](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwhserviceconsole.png)

5.  Examine the **Console Overview** and **Activity** Page.  
A new Canvas Page is opening.  
Examine the components of the Overview page:  
    * Storage used  
    * CPU utilization  
    * Running SQL statements  
    * Number of OCPUs allocated  
    * SQL statement response times

    ![Service Console Overview](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwhserviceconsoleoverview.png)

6.  To access detailed information about the service's performance, click the **Activity** tab in the Service Console.

    ![Service Console Activity](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwhserviceconsoleactivitysmall.png)

7.  Click the **Monitored SQL** tab to see information about current and past monitored SQL statements.

    ![Monitored SQL](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwhmonitoredsql.png)

8.  Navigate to OAC canvas, lets **refresh** the data and see if new queries gets generated in ADW.  
Open the browser page with your OAC canvas (previous lab) and click **Refresh Data** button from top right.

    ![Refresh Data](../monitor-adw/images/oacrefreshdata3.png)

9.  Navigate to ADW  tab you notice that no new queries are generated from OAC data refresh. What might be the reason?.

    ![No New Queries](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwhmonitoredsql3.png)

10. Lets inspect the Data Set. It is set to _automatic caching_ and hence, _queries fetched from cache_.  
Navigate to OAC, go to the **Data Pane > Data**, Right Click **DCA\_SALES\_DATA** and Select **Inspect**.  

    ![Inspect](../monitor-adw/images/projectdatasetinspectsmall.png)

11. Go to **General** tab and notice the **Data Access** is set _Automatic Caching_.

    ![Data Access](../monitor-adw/images/projectdatasetinspect2small.png)

12. We need to set it to _Live_ to make sure queries are fired against the database.  
Click **Data Access** and change to _Live_ > Click **Save** and then **Close**.

    ![Data Access Live](../monitor-adw/images/projectdatasetinspect3small.png)

13.   Lets regenerate the report to see if fresh queries are getting fired against the database.  
Repeat Steps 2.4 and 2.5.  
Now... if we refresh, fresh queries can be seen getting generated.
    
      ![New Queries](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwhmonitoredsql3.png)

## Task 2: Ad-hoc scaling up of ADW for optimal OAC experience  

You are going to create a slightly larger OAC report to mimic the performance scenario by adding greater level of granularity.  

In this section, you will scale up your Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) service to have more CPUs and understand the performance impact over a more complex OAC generated queries.

1.  OAC Canvas.  
Lets create a slightly larger report.  
Navigate to OAC, lets _turn off_ _Auto Apply Data_ to queue data requests while filtering or constructing visuals (not refresh the report immediately).  
Open the OAC browser and click **Auto Apply Data** button from bottom right.  

    ![Auto Apply Data](../monitor-adw/images/autoapplyoff.png)  
    > notice the button turned greyed out ![Auto Apply Data](../monitor-adw/images/autoapply2small.png)

2.  Replace _Sales Week_ with _Day of Year_.  
Go to **Data Panel**, Select  **Sales_Date > Day of Year** data element, drag and drop it over **Sales Week** from **Grammar Panel** **Category (X-Axis)** section.  
That is going to replace the existing data element (week) with a more granular one (day) and increase query complexity and ADW "work".  
    > Note: in case if the query is displaying an error, you can skip the replace step and use the visualization as is, it would be relevant enough

    ![Auto Apply Data](../monitor-adw/images/dayofayear.png)

3.  You get the message _**"Click the Auto-Apply Data below to refresh data"**_ with a clear indication where to go. 

    ![Auto Apply Data](../monitor-adw/images/autoapplyoff2.png)

4.  Refresh the data by clicking on **Auto Apply data** and notice that the report takes a while to run.![Auto Apply Data](../monitor-adw/images/autoapply3small.png)

5.  ADW **Service Console**  
Go to ADW console, note the duration that  the query ran with the current compute resources.  
You are going to compare this duration with the duration after you scale-up the ADW compute resources.

    ![Service Console Activity](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwhmonitoredsql4.png)

6.  Lets **Scale-Up** the ADW to use the maximum number of OCPUs that you can spare (16 OCPUs is a good number, but not a mandatory one). It takes about 90 seconds for the scale up process to complete.  
    > Note: in your training environments, if you are using the _Free Tier_ offer, or you have limited resources, you might not be able to actually scale-up the ADW to use 16 OCPUs; please use as reference this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=koOLAY48lZM&list=PL6gBNP-Fr8KVdvmZUg7eqXljXnFhidBV-&index=2) starting from minute 10:1  

    Go back to the **Cloud Console** you used during the provisioning exercise and open the database instance's **Details** page. From the **action menu**, click **Scale Up/Down**
    
    ![Monitored SQL](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwh-scaleupsmall.png)

7.  Fill in the form with the following information:  
     - **Change** **OCPU Count** to 16 (or to the highest value that you are able to provision)
     - **Auto-Scaling**: Disabled  
       > if you have enough resources you can enable auto-scaling; this feature allows your database to use up to three times the current base number of CPU cores at any time -> basically if this feature was disabled, just by enabling and leave the same number of OCPUs. you'll get extra performance when need it.

8.  Click **Update**

    ![Monitored SQL](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwh-scaleup16ocpusmall.png)

9.  In OAC page, lets **refresh** the data and see how fast the query is generated in a scaled-up ADW instance.  
Open the browser page with your OAC canvas and click **Refresh Data** button from top right.  

    ![Refresh Data](../monitor-adw/images/oac-refreshdatasmall.png)

10. In the ADW **Service Console > Activity > Monitored SQL**, note the duration that  the query ran with the updated compute resources.  
The new query generated has taken just a few milliseconds seconds to complete with 16 OCPUs being utilized.

    ![Service Console Activity](../monitor-adw/images/ociadwh-scaleup2.png)

## Task 3: Checking OAC Query Logs  

Administrators can examine the **underlying SQL query** requests that are executed.

1.  Going back to our visualization, lets Remove Analytics.  
Click on your visualization and you activate the Visualization Properties Pane on the lower left of the screen.  
Click on **Analytics** Properties and mouse hover on the **Trend** till you get an red x, Click on it and do the same with **Forecast**.  
   
    ![Remove Analytics](../monitor-adw/images/remove-analyticssmall.png)

2.  Lets save our project for further analysis.  
   Click on **Save** icon from upper top right of the screen. 

    ![Save Project](../monitor-adw/images/save-project0.png)

3.  Save Project as Training01 (or any name we choose). Type **Name**: **Training01** an Click **Save** button. 

    ![Save Project](../monitor-adw/images/save-projectsmall.png)

4.  OAC **Query Log**  
Lets now check the query logs generated inside of OAC.  
Click **Go Back** left arrow from upper left of the screen to go to the Analytics Home Page. ![Go Back](../monitor-adw/images/gobacksmall.png)

5.  Click **Navigator** and then Select **Console**.

    ![Console](../monitor-adw/images/navigator-consolesmall.png)

6.  Click **Sessions and Query Cache** under _Configuration and Administration_ section.

    ![Sessions and Query Cache](../monitor-adw/images/sessionandquery.png)

7.  The logs screen shows all the query logs and it can be sorted in ascending/descending order.  
Locate the **Cursor Cache** section, and review the query information recorded there. 

    ![Cursor Cache](../monitor-adw/images/managesessions.png)

8.  Sort the query log in a descending order.  
   **Sort By**> Select **Order Time Descending**.

    ![Order Time Descending](../monitor-adw/images/managesessionsdesc.png)

9.  Pick-up the most recent one and Click **View Log**.

    ![View Log](../monitor-adw/images/managesessionsquery.png)

10. **Logs** contain **logical SQL** generated by the BI Server and the **physical SQL** fired against the database.  
Scroll down the log file and you'll first find the **Logical SQL** and further down the **Physical SQL** as well. 

    ![Logical SQL](../monitor-adw/images/managesessionsquerylog.png)  
     > Note: for the physical SQL search the log for "_Sending query to database named_"
    
    ![Physical SQL](../monitor-adw/images/managesessionsqueryphi.png)

11. Bonus  
Lets test the _**Logical SQL**_ with _**OAC**_ and see the _**Physical SQL**_ in the _**ADW Console**_.

12. **Copy** the **Logical SQL** from the log file. 

     ![Copy Logical SQL](../monitor-adw/images/copylog.png)

13. Go back to **Console** and Click **Issue SQL** under _Configuration and Administration_ section.  
    
     ![Issue SQL](../monitor-adw/images/issuesql.png)

14. Paste the _Logical SQL_ and Click **Issue SQL** button.  

     ![Sessions and Query Cache](../monitor-adw/images/issuesql2.png)

15. You can quickly see the results (unformatted table below the SQL query). 

     ![Sessions and Query Cache](../monitor-adw/images/issuesql3.png)

16. Go to the ADW **Service Console > Activity > Monitored SQL**, select your query, right-click and select **Show Details**.

     ![Show Details](../monitor-adw/images/adwshowdetails.png)

17. Check the **Overview** tab, you'll find the Physical **SQL Text** which is identical with the one from OAC query log. 

     ![Overview](../monitor-adw/images/adwshowdetails2.png)

18. You can also browse through the other tabs as **Plan Statistics** to see other relevant query information.

     ![Plan Statistics](../monitor-adw/images/adwshowdetails3.png)

You have just finished learning how to **monitor ADW activity generated by OAC**, as well as the benefits of **ad-hoc scaling up ADW **for optimal OAC experience. You have also learnt how to check **OAC query logs** and find the **Logical and Physical generated SQL**.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next)
